.SH NAME
.B _printf\fR \- formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include \fB"main.h"

.B int printf(const char *\fIformat\fB, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fB_printf()\fR writes output to \fIstdout\fR, the standard 
output. This function writes under the control of a \fIformat\fR string that 
specifies how subsequent arguments (accessible through variable-length 
argument facilities of stdarg) are converted for output.

.B Return value
.in +2n
Once return is successful, \fB_printf()\fR returns the number of characters 
printed (null byte used to end output to strings excluded).

If output error is encountered, -1 is returned.
.in

.B Format of the format string
.in +2n
The format string is a constant character string which comprises of zero or 
more directives: ordinary characters (not \fB%\fR) which are copied unchanged 
to the output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which results in 
fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specifications are 
introduced by \fB%\fR character and ends with a \fIconversion specifier\fR.
Between the \fB%\fR character and conversion specifier, there may be (in 
order) zero or more \fIflags\fR, an optional minimum \fIfield width\fR, an 
optional \fIprecision\fR and also an optional \fIlength\fR modifier. These 
arguments must correspond with the conversion specifier, and are used in the 
order given.
.in

.B Flag Characters
.in +2n
The \fB%\fR character may be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

.RS
.B #
.in +2n
For \fBo\fR conversions, the first character of output string is prefixed with 
0 if it was not zero already. For x and X conversions, 0x or 0X, respectively, 
is prepended for non-zero numbers.

.RS
.B ''
.in +2n
(space) A blank is left before a positive numberor an empty string produced by 
a signed conversion.
.in
.RE

.RS
.B +
.in +2n
A (+ or -) sign is always produced right before a number which is produced by 
signed conversion.

.RS
.B 0
.in +2n
For \fBd\fR, \fBi\fR, \fBo\fR, \fBu\fR, \fBx\fR, and \fBX\fR conversions, the 
converted value is padded on the left wihth zeros rather than blanks. If the 
\fB0\fR flag is provide to a numeric conversion with a specified precision, 
it is ignored.
